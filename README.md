About
This learning project aims at exploring the use of an official Cinema dataset by reading, writing, cleaning and then implementing a Machine Learning model to be trained and predict the success of a movie release. Success can be measured by various different parameters; this program aims at finding relationships between those parameters and consider what makes a movie "succesful". Will then compare the accuracy of both linear Regression against Random Forest Regression.

Program will undergo this implicit pipeline: Cleaning phase -> Understanding data -> Prediction Models -> post-fact data

Dependencies
Tools include: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, SciKit-Learn
